\section{General discussion}
In Experiment 1 we provided a clear demonstration of an ABC renewal effect -- restoration of an extinguished response consequent to a change of context, Figure \ref{fig:Atrace}. We also showed suppression of responding to cue $D$ when it was presented in the extinction context, Figure \ref{fig:Gtrace}, suggesting that context inhibition had developed during extinction, a requirement of the protection from extinction account of renewal. A reasonable objection to the context inhibition claim is that a control condition was not included, the suppressed response to $D$ in the extinction test may have occurred even if context $B:$ had not been used for extinction. However, the procedures used in the current experiments matched closely those used in \textcite{Glautier2013a}\label{lab:previousCI} where appropriate control contexts were used and the results obtained then and now were also closely matched. From \textcite{Glautier2013a}, collapsing over the two experiments and experimental conditions (Single and Multiple context extinction), the mean rating for the test cue equivalent to $D$ in the current study (\citeauthor [Figures 2 and 3 cue $G$ from][]{Glautier2013a}) was \Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataPrev[1],2)} (SE=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataPrev[2],2)}, n=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataPrev[3],0)}) compared with \Sexpr{fn$fndp(ciDataPrev[1],2)} (SE=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(ciDataPrev[2],2)}, n=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(ciDataPrev[3],0)}) for the control conditions, again collapsing over the two experiments and conditions (No extinction and No extinction no $A\rightarrow X$). In the current investigation collapsing over both tests on cue $D$, as done in \citeauthor{Glautier2013a}, the mean rating for cue $D$ was \Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataCurr[1],2)} (SE=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataCurr[2],2)}, n=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataCurr[3],0)}).

However, again repeating the findings of \citeauthor{Glautier2013a}, we noted that a substantial proportion of participants (31/80, approximately 40\%) were classified as non-inhibitors on the basis that they showed at least one response to cue $D$ in the two trials of the summation test. As outlined in the introduction we hypothesised that classifying participants as inhibitors and non-inhibitors, according to whether or not they responded in the summation test, would indicate the associative structures that were used to resolve the ambiguity in the predictive value of cue $A$ during extinction. Importantly, we observed that the classification established in Experiment 1 enabled prediction of performance in the feature negative survival test in Experiment 2. Specifically, a feature negative discimination survived reversal training of the feature to a greater extent among the non-inhibitors than amongst the inhibitors (Figure \ref{fig:FNIT}), consistent with the logic of the proposed associative structures as described in the Introduction. Our conclusion that non-inhibitors and inhibitors differed on feature negative survival after reversal training of the feature was supported Bayesian analyses of the data. In the first analysis a Bayesian t-test \parencite{MoreyRouder2018} was used to assess whether or not there was a difference between inhibitors and non-inhibitors on responding in the feature negative survival test. The t-test showed that the null hypothesis should be judged to be \Sexpr{fn$fndp(bftt,1)} less likely than the alternative given the data, substantial evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis \parencite{Jeffreys1961}. The second analysis was used to obtain full posterior distributions representing the responses on the feature negative survival test. The means of the posterior distributions, shown in Figure \ref{fig:posteriors}, for the non-inhibitor and inhibitor group ratings were \Sexpr{fn$fndp(noPost_2,2)} and \Sexpr{fn$fndp(noPost_2+deltaPost_2,2)} respectively and the common standard deviation  estimated for both groups was \Sexpr{fn$fndp(sigma_2,2)}. 

Until this point we have considered that participants can be classified as those who tend to use first-order strategies and those who tend to use second-order strategies to resolve the ambiguity that arises during extinction and our results are consistent with the view that this categorisation remains stable over two different tasks. In the Introduction we outlined \trw as a standard example of a first-order associative model and a second-order occasion-setting model and we derived the prediction that participants using first-order strategies would respond more strongly in the $IJ$ compound test after reinforcement of feature $J$ than participants using second-order strategies. However, whilst failure to observe abolition of feature negative discrimination performance after reinforcement of the feature has frequently been used in arguments to support the view that learning in both animals and humans involves second-order associative structures \parencite{BaeyensVervlietEtAl2004,MorellHolland1993,TraskThrailkillEtAl2017} this observation has also been discussed in relation to stimulus configuration \parencite{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998,Williams1995a}. Therefore we now consider whether or not it would be better to think about the differences between our participants in terms of configural learning. Perhaps a distinction along such an axis fits the facts just as well as differences along an axis in which participants differ in their deployment of first and second-order strategies. 

The investigations of \textcite{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998} and \textcite{Williams1995a} both contained experiments using predictive tasks with human participants in which a feature negative discrimination survived feature reversal training and the authors identified conditions in which a configural associative model \parencite{Pearce1987,Pearce1994} could explain survival. Focusing on \let\old\postnotedelim \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{'}\citeauthor[][s]{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998}\renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} discussion of the \citeauthor{Pearce1994} model, note first that this model makes use of similar principles to those used in \trw but that the associations that are learned are associations between mental representations of whole patterns (stimulus configurations) and the US. For example in \trw during feature negative training ($I+$/$IJ-$ trials) an excitatory association between cue $I$ and the US is formed alongside an inhibitory association between cue $J$ and the US. In contrast, in \let\old\postnotedelim \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{'}\citeauthor[][s]{Pearce1994}\renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} model an excitatory association between cue $I$ and the US is formed alongside an inhibitory association between a configural cue $IJ$ and the US. The effect of reinforced feature trials in \trw has already been covered (page \pageref{lab:reversalStructures}) and it clearly implies a strong response should then be seen when the $IJ$ compound is presented for test. In \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{'}\citeauthor[][s]{Pearce1994}\renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} model the reversal training will result in an excitatory representation forming between $J$ and the US, thus there are now three associations ($I^+\rightarrow US$, $IJ^-\rightarrow US$, and $J^+\rightarrow US$ where the plus and minus signs indicate excitatory and inhibitory respectively) which need to be taken into account to understand the predicted response in the $IJ$ compound test. The response to the $IJ$ compound would be determined by the state of the $IJ^-\rightarrow US$ association and by generalisation between the cues $I$, $J$, and the $IJ$ configuration. Strong generalisation from $J$ would cause loss of the feature negative discrimination but if there was little or no generalisation then the $J+$ trials would have little effect on the discrimination \parencite{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998}. 

Suppose now that our non-inhibitor group should be more properly labelled `configural with limited generalisation' and that the inhibitor group should be labelled `configural'. Presumeably this classification could be used to explain the Experiment 2 results (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:FNIT}) but would a configural with limited generalisation group be predicted to show weak inhibition in the Experiment 1 summation test? The answer is clearly no. Recall that the non-inhibitor group responded more to cue $D$ in that test than the inhibition group. Analysis in terms of configural learning indicates that at the time of the summation test there would be two relevant associations established during the acquisition and extinction phases, namely $A\!:\!D^+\rightarrow US$ and $B\!:\!A^-\rightarrow US$, and responding to the novel test $B\!:\!D$ depends on generalisation between $B\!:\!D$ and the configurations $A\!:\!D$ and $B\!:\!A$. $B\!:\!D$ shares one common element with $A\!:\!D$ and one common element with $B\!:\!A$ and a response is predicted if the absolute value of excitatory association exceeds that of the absolute value of inhibitory association. The difference between the absolute excitatory and inhibitory values reduces with weaker generalisation, consequently a response is less likely if there is weaker generalisation i.e. in the configural with limited generalisation group (AKA non-inhibitor) than if there is stronger generalisation i.e. in the configural group (AKA inhibitor). We observed the opposite therefore a configural account of the group differences in Experiment 1 results is incompatible with a configural account of the group differences in Experiment 2. Simulations, a summary of which can be found at \url{https://osf.io/xwp2d/}, were carried out to confirm this analysis.


Before we conclude by a consideration of some of the practical implications of the current findings a comment on one further aspect of the data is warranted. Although we can be reasonably confident that there exists a real difference between inhibitors and non-inhibitors the data shows that even amongst the inhibitors that the feature negative discrimination was not fully reversed by the $J+$ trials of the feature reversal phase -- the response to the $IJ$ compound was not strong (Figure \ref{fig:FNIT}). One possible explanation for this is that there were insufficient $J+$ trials during the reversal phase but this is rather unsatisfactory  because responding to cue $J$ was strong by the end of the phase (Figure \ref{fig:FNFNR}). Another possibility is that inhibitors do not treat the $IJ$ compound in a strictly elemental additive fashion \parencite[e.g. as outlined in the replaced elements model of][]{WagnerBrandonEtAl2001}. Indeed studies of summation effects in animals and in humans indicate a complex picture in which responding to a compound is not a straightforward function of responding to the elements \parencite[e.g.][]{PearceRedheadEtAl2002,GlautierRedheadEtAl2010}. Clearly there are other possibilities and directions for further study but the simple prediction derived in the Introduction, based on Figure \ref{fig:reversalStructures}, that responding in the $IJ$ test would be greater for the inhibitors than the non-inhibitors was supported by our results.

We conclude with a brief review of some of the more practical implications of the current findings. First, there is a possible link between individual differences in conditioned inhibition, as discussed and studied above, and the general concept of inhibition which has been linked to a range of disorders including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders, and the personality trait of impulsivity \parencite{DaweLoxton2004,RobbinsGillanEtAl2012,HeCassadayEtAl2013}. Second, there are possible implications for cue exposure treatments for anxiety and addiction, among other disorders. Cue exposure treatments have a clear and specific rationale in terms of extinction but the fact that there appear to be different underlying mechanisms through which extinction can be achieved suggests different ways to improve cue exposure outcomes. Taking links between conditioned and other types of inhibition first, it is already clear that it is an oversimplification to consider inhibition as a unitary construct. There are at least three recognised types of inhibition namely motor, cognitive, and attentional each of which is measured using different tasks and for which different neural loci of control have been identified \parencite[e.g.][]{Nigg2000,EagleBaunezEtAl2008}. Despite the fact that conditioned inhibition has been widely studied in the learning literature it is not clear where it sits in overall taxonomy of inhibition. There are few examples in which it has been studied alongside other measures of inhibition (e.g. Stroop task, Stop-Signal Reaction Time) or in relation to disorders in which inhibition is impaired. Among the studies where conditioned inhibition has been examined there have been reports of weaker conditioned inhibition linked to schizotypy, schizophrenia, and personality disorders \parencite{MigoCorbettEtAl2006,HeCassadayEtAl2011,HeCassadayEtAl2012} but no evidence of a link between conditioned inhibition and Tourette's Syndrome \parencite{HeymKantiniEtAl2014} nor between conditioned inhibition and behavioural inhibition as measured by the BIS component of the BIS-BAS questionaire \parencite{CarverWhite1994,HeCassadayEtAl2013}. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions given the number of studies of this kind that currently exist but one lesson from the current research is that a finer grained analysis may be useful. For example, a standard conditioned inhibition test may simply sort participants according to preferred strategy (first or second order) rather than measuring conditioned inhibition strength \textit{per se} complicating analysis of the relationship between conditioned inhibition and other types of inhibition.

The identification of individual differences in the mechanisms underlying behavioural extinction also has some implications for attempts to improve cue-exposure treatments for addiction and other disorders. \Cets have been highly successful in treatments for phobias and obsessional compulsive disorders \parencite[e.g.][]{Choy2007} but less so in the case of addictions \parencite[e.g.][]{ConklinTiffany2002, DaweReesEtAl2002,KavanaghSitharthanEtAl2006,DrummondGlautier1994}. \Mcets may improve treatment outcomes \parencite{ShibanPauliEtAl2013,ShibanSchelhornEtAl2015} and this effect could be mediated either through a reduction in protection from extinction or by increasing the number of stimulus elements that could exert occasion-setting control \parencite{Glautier2013a}. However, some suggestions for improving \cet seem more likely to be effective for inhibitors than for non-inhibitors. If extinction is based on a \rw like process then increasing prediction error during extinction, by presenting a compound of multiple excitatory cues, should deepen extinction and this effect has been observed in some studies \parencite[e.g.][]{ThomasAyres2004,LeungReeksEtAl2012} but not in others \parencite[e.g.][]{HolmesGriffithsEtAl2014,GriffithsHolmesEtAl2017}. The results of the studies reported herein, showing stable individual differences in the extent to which extinction is based on conditioned inhibition, suggests that \cet could be tailored towards these individual differences. Extinction based on excitatory cue compounds should produced the greatest benefits for those identified as inhibitors.
