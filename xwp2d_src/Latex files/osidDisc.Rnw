\section{General discussion}
In Part 1 of each of the current experiments we provided reliable demonstrations of ABC renewal effects -- restoration of an extinguished response consequent to a change of context (Figures \ref{fig:AtraceE1} and \ref{fig:AtraceE2}). We also clearly showed that context inhibition developed during extinction, due to the suppression of responding to cue G which occurred when $G$ was presented in the extinction context (Figures \ref{fig:GtraceE1} and \ref{fig:GtraceE2}). A reasonable objection to this claim is that a control condition was not included, the suppressed response to cue G in the extinction test may have occurred even if context B had not been used for extinction. However, the procedures used in the current experiments matched closely those used in \textcite{Glautier2013a}\label{lab:previousCI} where appropriate control contexts were used and the results obtained then and now were also closely matched. From \textcite{Glautier2013a}, collapsing over the two experiments and experimental conditions (Single and Multiple context extinction), the mean rating for the test cue (\citeauthor[cue G, Figures 2 and 3 from][]{Glautier2013a}) was \Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataPrev[1],2)} (SE=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataPrev[2],2)}, n=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataPrev[3],0)}) compared with \Sexpr{fn$fndp(ciDataPrev[1],2)} (SE=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(ciDataPrev[2],2)}, n=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(ciDataPrev[3],0)}) for the control conditions, again collapsing over the two experiments and conditions (No extinction and No extinction no $A\rightarrow X$). In the current investigation collapsing over both experiments and over both tests on cue G, as done in \citeauthor{Glautier2013a}, the mean rating for cue G was \Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataCurr[1],2)} (SE=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataCurr[2],2)}, n=\Sexpr{fn$fndp(eiDataCurr[3],0)}).

However, again repeating the findings of \citeauthor{Glautier2013a}, we noted that a substantial proportion of participants (31/80, approximately 40\%) were classified as non-inhibitors on the basis that they showed at least one response to cue G in the two trials of the summation test. As outlined in the introduction we hypothesised that this classification of participants, as inhibitors and non-inhibitors, indicated that different associative structures were being used to resolve the ambiguity in the predictive value of cue A during extinction. Importantly, in Part 2 of each of the current experiments, we observed that the classification established in Part 1 enabled prediction of performance in a test in Part 2. Specifically, a feature negative discimination survived reversal training of the feature to a greater extent among the non-inhibitors than amongst the inhibitors, consistent with the logic of the proposed associative structures as described in the Introduction (Figure \ref{fig:inht}). Our conclusion that non-inhibitors and inhibitors differ on feature negative survival after reversal training of the feature is supported by replication in two experiments and in Bayesian analyses of the data combined over the two experiments. These analyses showed that the posterior distributions representing the responses on the feature negative survival test differed substantially for the two groups (Figure \ref{fig:posteriors}). We estimated an effect size index for the difference between the two groups as $\delta = 0.55$ (95\% credible interval $[\Sexpr{fn$fndp(lo95_1,2)},\Sexpr{fn$fndp(hi95_1,2)}]$, Figure \ref{fig:effectsizes}) which in \let\old\postnotedelim \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{'}\citeauthor[][s]{Cohen1988}\renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} terms is a medium effect size \parencite{Cohen1988}.

Until this point we have considered that participants can be classified as those who tend to use first-order strategies and those who tend to use second-order strategies to resolve the ambiguity that arises during extinction and our results are consistent with the view that this categorisation remains stable over two different tasks. In the Introduction we outlined \trw as a standard example of a first-order associative model and a second-order occasion-setting model and we derived the prediction that participants using first-order strategies would respond more strongly in the $AB$ compound test after reinforcement of feature $B$ than participants using second-order strategies. Failure to observe abolition of feature negative discrimination performance after reinforcement of the feature has frequently been used in arguments to support the view that learning in both animals and humans involves second-order associative structures \parencite{BaeyensVervlietEtAl2004,MorellHolland1993,TraskThrailkillEtAl2017}. However, this observation has also been discussed in relation to stimulus configuration and rule-based learning \parencite{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998,Williams1995a} therefore we now consider whether or not it would be better to think about the differences between our participants in terms of a) configural learning or b) rule learning. Perhaps distinctions along one or both of these axes fit the facts just as well differences in the deployment of first and second-order strategies. 

The investigations of \textcite{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998} and \textcite{Williams1995a} both contained experiments using predictive tasks with human participants in which a feature negative discrimination survived feature reversal training and the authors identified conditions in which a configural associative model \parencite{Pearce1987,Pearce1994} could explain survival. Focusing on \let\old\postnotedelim \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{'}\citeauthor[][s]{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998}\renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} discussion of the \citeauthor{Pearce1994} model, note first that this model makes use of similar principles to those used in \trw but that the associations that are learned are associations between mental representations of whole patterns (stimulus configurations) and the US. For example in \trw during feature negative training ($A+$/$AB-$ trials) an excitatory association between cue A and the US is formed alongside an inhibitory association between cue B and the US. In contrast, in \let\old\postnotedelim \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{'}\citeauthor[][s]{Pearce1994}\renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} model an excitatory association between cue A and the US is formed alongside an inhibitory association between a configural cue AB and the US. The effect of reinforced feature trials in \trw has already been covered (page \pageref{lab:reversalStructures}) and it clearly implies a strong response should then be seen when the $AB$ compound is presented for test. In \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{'}\citeauthor[][s]{Pearce1994}\renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} model the reversal training will result in an excitatory representation forming between $B$ and the US, thus there are now three associations ($A^+\rightarrow US$, $AB^-\rightarrow US$, and $B^+\rightarrow US$ where the plus and minus signs indicate excitatory and inhibitory respectively) which need to be taken into account to understand the predicted response in the $AB$ compound test. The response to the $AB$ compound is determined by the state of the $AB^-\rightarrow US$ association and by generalisation between the cues $A$, $B$, and the $AB$ configuration. Strong generalisation from $B$ would cause loss of the feature negative discrimination but if there was little or no generalisation then the $B+$ trials would have little effect on the discrimination \parencite{ShanksCharlesEtAl1998}. 

Suppose now that our non-inhibitor group should be more properly labelled `configural with limited generalisation' and that the inhibitor group should be labelled `configural'. Presumeably this classification could be used to explain the Part 2 results (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:inht}) but would a configural with limited generalisation group be predicted to show weak inhibition in the Part 1 summation test? The answer is clearly no. Recall that the non-inhibitor group responded more to cue G in that test than the inhibition group. Analysis in terms of configural learning indicates that at the time of the summation test there would be two relevant associations established during the acquisition and extinction phases, namely $A\!:\!G^+\rightarrow US$ and $B\!:\!A^-\rightarrow US$, and responding to the novel test $B\!:\!G$ depends on generalisation between $B\!:\!G$ and these associations. $B\!:\!G$ shares one common element with $A\!:\!G$ and one common element with $B\!:\!A$ and a response is predicted if the absolute value of excitatory association exceeds that of the absolute value of inhibitory association and a response is less likely if there is weaker generalisation i.e. in the configural with limited generalisation group (AKA non-inhibitor) than if there is stronger generalisation i.e. in the configural group (AKA inhibitor). We observed the opposite therefore a configural account of the group differences in Part 1 results is incompatible with a configural account of the group differences in Part 2.

A similar line of argument can be used to determine whether or not the observed group differences could be due to differences in rule-based learning. It has been proposed that human learning is better described in terms of rule-based rather than associative mechanisms \parencite[e.g.][]{MitchellDeHouwerEtAl2009} and \textcite{ShanksDarby1998} found evidence that rule-based learning was associated with better performance in a negative patterning discrimination. A negative patterning discrimination involves $A+$, $B+$, and $AB-$ trials and, in fact, these are exactly the trial types to which our participants were exposed in Part 2 (c.f. Table \ref{tab:designP2}). Of course in our design the $B+$ trials were presented after the $A+/AB-$ trials but supposing that our non-inhibitors were better labelled `rule-followers', parsing the trials as a single negative patterning discrimination, and the inhibitors labelled `associative' then perhaps this could explain the Part 2 results -- rule-followers should show a weak response on the $AB$ test. But would this lead to a prediction of weak inhibilintion in a rule-following group in Part 1? Once again the answer is clearly no. An appropriate context dependent extinction rule would be `no X outcomes in context B', hence a response should be at least as unlikely in a rule-following group (AKA non-inhibitor) as in an associative group (AKA inhibitor). This conflicts with our observations therefore a rule-based account of the group differences in Part 1 results is incompatible with a rule-based account of the group differences in Part 2.

We conclude with a brief review of some of the more practical implications of the current findings. First, there is a possible link between individual differences in conditioned inhibition, as discussed and studied above, and the general concept of inhibition which has been linked to a range of disorders including addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders, and the personality trait of impulsivity \parencite{DaweLoxton2004,RobbinsGillanEtAl2012,HeCassadayEtAl2013}. Second, there are possible implications for cue exposure treatments for anxiety and addiction, among other disorders. Cue exposure treatments have a clear and specific rationale in terms of extinction but the fact that there appear to be different underlying mechanisms through which extinction can be achieved suggests different ways to improve cue exposure outcomes. Taking links between conditioned and other types of inhibition first, it is already clear that it is an oversimplification to consider inhibition as a unitary construct. There are at least three recognised types of inhibition namely motor, cognitive, and attentional each of which is measured using different tasks and for which different neural loci of control have been identified \parencite[e.g.][]{Nigg2000,EagleBaunezEtAl2008}. Despite the fact that conditioned inhibition has been widely studied in the learning literature it is not clear where it sits in overall taxonomy of inhibition. There are few examples in which it has been studied alongside other measures of inhibition (e.g. Stroop task, Stop-Signal Reaction Time) or in relation to disorders in which inhibition is impaired. Among the studies where conditioned inhibition has been examined there have been reports of weaker conditioned inhibition linked to schizotypy, schizophrenia, and personality disorders \parencite{MigoCorbettEtAl2006,HeCassadayEtAl2011,HeCassadayEtAl2012} but no evidence of a link between conditioned inhibition and Tourette's Syndrome \parencite{HeymKantiniEtAl2014} nor between conditioned inhibition and behavioural inhibition as measured by the BIS component of the BIS-BAS questionaire \parencite{CarverWhite1994,HeCassadayEtAl2013}. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions given the number of studies of this kind that currently exist but one lesson from the current research is that a finer grained analysis may be useful. For example, a standard conditioned inhibition test may simply sort participants according to preferred strategy (first or second order) rather than measuring conditioned inhibition strength \textit{per se} complicating analysis of the relationship between conditioned inhibition and other types of inhibition.

The identification of individual differences in the mechanisms underlying behavioural extinction also has some implications for attempts to improve cue-exposure treatments for addiction and other disorders. \Cets have been highly successful in treatments for phobias and obsessional compulsive disorders \parencite[e.g.][]{Choy2007} but less so in the case of addictions \parencite[e.g.][]{ConklinTiffany2002, DaweReesEtAl2002,KavanaghSitharthanEtAl2006,DrummondGlautier1994}. \Mcets may improve treatment outcomes \parencite{ShibanPauliEtAl2013,ShibanSchelhornEtAl2015} and this effect could be mediated either through a reduction in protection from extinction or by increasing the number of stimulus elements that could exert occasion-setting control \parencite{Glautier2013a}. However, some suggestions for improving \cet seem more likely to be effective for inhibitors than for non-inhibitors. If extinction is based on a \rw like process then increasing prediction error during extinction, by presenting a compound of multiple excitatory cues, should deepen extinction and this effect has been observed in some studies \parencite[e.g.][]{ThomasAyres2004,LeungReeksEtAl2012} but not in others \parencite[e.g.][]{HolmesGriffithsEtAl2014,GriffithsHolmesEtAl2017}. The results of the studies reported herein, showing stable individual differences in the extent to which extinction is based on conditioned inhibition, suggests that \cet could be tailored towards these individual differences. Extinction based on excitatory cue compounds should produced the greatest benefits for those identified as inhibitors.
