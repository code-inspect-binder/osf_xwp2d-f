\section{Introduction}
Associative learning plays a crucial role in the survival of organisms by facilitating the acquisition of responses to stimuli which signal significant events. However, acquisition is only half of the story. In an ever-changing environment a response that was once appropriate may become redundant or even maladaptive if it continues to occur when the environmental conditions change. For example an animal may learn that a particular location is a good source of food but if it continues returning to that location after the source is exhausted it will waste energy that could be better spent foraging elsewhere. Procedurally, presenting a \cs (CS) alone, without the \us (US) it was previously paired with, is known as extinction. During extinction the \cri (CR) produced by the CS is observed to decline in magnitude and probability until at some point extinction appears to be complete. Superficially extinction resembles unlearning and in one of the most widely cited theoretical models of associative learning, \trw \parencite{RescorlaWagner1972}, extinction is exactly that -- the undoing, without leaving a trace, of a previously learned association.

However, it is well established that extinction cannot be understood as simple unlearning. Spontaneous recovery and renewal are among those phenomena which demonstrate that traces of the original learning survive extinction \parencite[e.g.][]{Bouton1994}. Spontaneous recovery refers to renewed CRs that occur when the CS is presented after a delay following extinction. \citeauthor{Brooks1993} trained rats with a tone CS signalling delivery of food then presented the CS alone during an extinction phase. Responding clearly declined during extinction. Animals were then given test presentations of the CS either five hours or six days after extinction. Animals tested five hours after extinction showed a slight increase in responding to the CS compared to that seen at the end of extinction. In contrast, animals tested six days after extinction showed dramatically increased responding to the CS compared to that seen at the end of extinction. Actually responding in the test was slightly higher than it was before extinction, a clear spontaneous recovery effect showing that extinction did not simply erase what had been learned during acquisition \parencite{Brooks1993}. Renewal refers to renewed CRs consequent to a contextual changes after extinction. \let\old\postnotedelim \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{ }\citeauthor[][(Experiment 1)]{BoutonKing1983} \renewcommand{\postnotedelim}{\old} trained rats with a tone CS signalling electric shock in one context, context A (A:T+ trials\footnote{The colon indicates that identifier A refers to a contextual cue. In contrast an undecorated identifier (e.g. T) refers to a discrete cue. When an experiment only involves a single US the  `+' sign indicates a trial with the US and a `-' sign indicates a trial without the US.}), and then extinguished the CS in another context, context B (B:T- trials), before testing the CS back in context A. Clear extinction effects were seen but responding returned when the CS was tested in context A. These results were supported by further tests which showed that the renewal effect was not mediated by the excitatory properties of context A \parencite{BoutonKing1983}. Other rat studies, where testing was carried out in a novel context C (an ABC design as opposed to an ABA design), confirmed that renewal effects do not depend on the excitatory properties of the test context \parencite{BoutonBolles1979}.

Results such as these present important problems for learning theories and in what follows we describe two leading explanations for renewal to set the stage for the experiments to be presented below. The central question is, how we can understand the decline in responding that is seen during extinction when there is clear evidence that the original learning remains intact? We argue that two leading explanations for renewal, one based on context inhibition and one based on occasion-setting, are not mutually exclusive \parencite[e.g.][]{BoutonNelson1994}. The experiments reported below show that human participants may be categorised into one of two groups. In one group, inhibitors, renewal seems to be controlled by inhibitory associations involving the experimental context. In another group, non-inhibitors, we argue that renewal is controlled by an occasion-setting mechanism. The classification of participants into these two groups appears to be relatively stable, allowing predictions to be made across different experimental procedures, and indicates some practical implications. We leave consideration of these practical implications for the Discussion to focus here on two theoretical explanations for renewal.

In associative models learning is conceptualised as changes in the strength of associative links between mental representations of CSs and USs. We review here the operation of \trw as a `standard' model of associative learning \parencite{RescorlaWagner1972}. Although \trw was developed as a model of \Pc in animals its principles are sufficiently general to have been successfully imported into new domains. \Trw has been considered a viable candidate model in a variety of human learning tasks including predictive, causal, and Pavlovian learning \parencite[e.g.][]{DickinsonShanksEtAl1984,Lachnit1988,ChapmanRobbins1990}. In \trw, in the case of simple excitatory learning, where a CS is repeatedly paired with a US, the association strength, $V$, increases towards an asymptote and is greater than zero. When $V>0$ presentation of the CS activates the US representation -- informally presentation of the CS leads to an expectation of the US through spreading activation. However, $V$ may also be less than zero, in which case inhibitory, rather than excitatory learning has taken place. When there is an inhibitory CS-US association presentation of the CS effectively suppresses expectation of the US. Inhibitory learning takes place when an expected US fails to occur and is of particular concern in the current analysis because US expectancy is violated when extinction begins. 

\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:rwSimple} \Delta V=\alpha \beta (\lambda-\Sigma V)
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:rwSimple} is the fundamental \rwm learning equation\label{lab:extstr}. In Equation
\ref{eq:rwSimple} $\Delta V$ is the change in the associative strength between the mental
representation of a predictive stimulus (such as a tone CS) and the representation of the outcome
(such as a shock US) that occurs on a single learning trial. $\Delta V$ is a function of two
learning rate parameters, $\alpha$ for the CS and $\beta$ for the US, and the parenthesised error
term. In the error term $\lambda$ is the value of the US on that trial (usually 1 or 0 for the
occurrence and non-occurrence of the US, respectively) and $\Sigma V$ is the summed associative
strength of all the predictors that are present on the trial. To see how inhibitory learning takes
place during extinction consider the associative strength of cue A after an acquisition phase
involving a series of $A\!:\!A+$ trials. Asymptotically $V_{A:}+V_A \rightarrow 1$ and
$\sfrac{V_{A:}}{V_A}=\sfrac{\alpha_{A:}}{\alpha_A}$. Following acquisition there is an extinction
phase involving $\!B:\!A-$ trials. At the start of extinction $V_{B:}=0$ and $\Sigma V=V_{B:}+V_A>0$.
During extinction $\lambda=0$ and since $\alpha>0$ and $\beta>0$ then $\Delta V <0$. Since
$V_{B:}=0$ at the start of extinction $V_{B:}$ becomes negative during extinction and $V_A$
declines. Learning (and responding) during extinction stops when $V_{B:}+V_A=0$ and at this point $B\!:$
is inhibitory ($V_{B:}<0$) while $A$ remains excitatory ($V_A>0$). The presence of inhibitory $B\!:$ is
said to protect $A$ from extinction.

Despite the fact that the presence of an inhibitory CS during extinction can protect a CS from extinction \parencite[e.g.][]{Rescorla2003} there are few experiments which have found evidence for context inhibition developing during extinction, calling into question the proposal that protection from extinction could occur. In the study mentioned above \citeauthor{BoutonKing1983} used a summation test to look for context inhibition \parencite{BoutonKing1983}. A summation test involves presenting an excitatory cue in compound with a putative inhibitor \parencite{Rescorla1969} and in this case \citeauthor{BoutonKing1983} presented an excitatory CS in the extinction context but no inhibition was detected. More recently \textcite{PolackLabordaEtAl2012} reported evidence for extinction contexts becoming inhibitory in a summation test, and also in a retardation test in which learning is acquired more slowly in the presence of the inhibitor than in its absence \parencite{Rescorla1969}. \citeauthor{PolackLabordaEtAl2012} found clearest evidence for context inhibition during extinction when using short inter-trial-intervals and suggest that this variable may explain why there are few reports of context inhibition in the literature. Again using a summation test but this time using human subjects both \textcite{NelsonSanjuanEtAl2011} and \textcite{HavermansKeukerEtAl2005} found reduced conditioned suppression when an excitatory cue was presented in the extinction context indicating that the context was inhibitory. However, these results are ambiguous since \textcite{NelsonSanjuanEtAl2011} demonstrated that conditioned suppression was also reduced when the excitatory cue was presented in an associatively neutral context. Thus, any putative conditioned inhibitory effect of the extinction context added nothing to conditioned suppression produced by a novel cue-context combination. However, \textcite{Glautier2013a} found clear evidence for context inhibition with appropriate controls using a predictive learning task (see Discussion, page \pageref{lab:previousCI}) so it seems as though it may be premature to rule-out a role for protection from extinction in extinction and renewal effects.

Partly as a result of failures to find extinction context inhibition effects alternatives to the protection from extinction explanation for renewal have been developed. Occasion setters are stimuli that can be shown to influence the expression of an association between a CS and a US without themselves being directly associated with the US. Instead they function by controlling an `and-gate' which switches the CS-US association on or off \parencite{Bouton1994,Holland1992,Swartzentruber1995}. The occasion-setting mechanism is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:extinctionStructures} where it is contrasted with \trw. Figure \ref{fig:extinctionStructures} shows the hypothesised associative structures that are formed after acquisition (left-hand side) and after extinction (right-hand side). $CS_A$ was paired with the US during an acquisition phase to produce an $A\rightarrow US$ association (left) and then, in a new context, context B,  $CS_A$ was extinguished by presentation without the US. According to \trw, as explained above, this produces an inhibitory association between $CS_A$ and context B (bottom right). In contrast, in the occasion-setting model, it is assumed that context B forms an inhibitory link with the $A\rightarrow US$ structure (top-right) so that when context B is present the association is switched off and switched on otherwise. We term direct associations between CSs and the US `first-order' and associations which operate on first-order associations `second-order'. It should be apparent that renewal of responding is predicted for the second-order model, as well as the first-order model, because when $CS_A$ is presented outside of context B the $A\rightarrow US$ association will be active.\label{lab:extstr1}

The current investigation follows-up the work of \textcite{Glautier2013a}. It was based on an analysis of renewal in which it was assumed that the two mechanisms outlined above could operate. During an extinction phase of a renewal experiment we assumed that participants could suppress responding by conditionalising an $A\rightarrow US$ association that had been learned during the acquisition phase on the experimental context or by learning that the context was inhibitory as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:extinctionStructures}. In \citeauthor{Glautier2013a}, although there was a clear overall context inhibition effect, approximately 50\% of participants showed some responding to a test cue when it was presented in the extinction context. It was hypothesised that extinction in participants who failed to suppress responding in the extinction context summation test would have had extinction performance controlled by second-order associations. This is because one of the defining features of an occasion-setter is that its occasion-setting function is specific to a particular CS-US relation \parencite[e.g.][]{Holland1989,Holland1992}. Thus, if $B\!:$ has occasion set the $CS_A\rightarrow US$ relation then it should not affect another CS-US relation (e.g. $CS_B\rightarrow US$). In contrast, conditioned inhibition shows no such specificity since it operates on the US representation. Thus, if $B\!:$ has become inhibitory it should suppress responding to any excitatory cue it is compounded with. 

Of course a classification of participants based on a single test has little value unless there is some independent predictive value of that classification. Therefore each of the identically designed experiments reported on below had two parts. Part 1 was a renewal experiment, based closely on \textcite{Glautier2013a}, which provided an inhibition score for each participant. On the basis of these scores participants were classified as inhibitors or non-inhibitors.
In Part 2 participants underwent feature negative training\label{lab:extstr1}, followed by reinforcement of the feature, and then a test to see if the feature negative discrimination was disrupted. It was predicted that the discrimination would be maximally disrupted in the inhibitors, i.e. those predisposed to learn first order solutions. This would be consistent with previous reports which have shown that feature negative discriminations in which the feature is trained as an occasion-setter using serial presentation can be maintained after reinforced trials with the feature \parencite[e.g.][]{Holland1984, Rescorla1987, Holland1992}. The rationalisation of this prediction is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:reversalStructures}\label{lab:reversalStructures}. After training with $A+$ and $AB-$ trials responding could be controlled by first-order associative structures (left-hand side, bottom) or by second-order structures (left-hand side, top). Following reinforcement of feature $B$ the second-order associative structures formed by the non-inhibitors will have an excitatory input to the US representation from $B$ (right-hand side, top). There is also an excitatory input to the US representation from $A$, but this association is gated closed by the presence of $B$. In contrast the inhibitors will have excitatory inputs to the US representation from both $A$ and $B$ (right-hand side, bottom). Consequently we predicted stronger responses in the $AB$ compound test for the inhibitors than for the non-inhibitors.
