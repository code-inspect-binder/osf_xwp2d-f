Figures inhibGen.jpeg and fnrGen.jpeg show the results of simulations of the designs used in Glautier and Brudan (2018, 2019) using Pearce's (1994) configural model. Simulations were carried out using d=2 (normal generalisation) and d=3 (reduced generalisation). The other parameters were context salience (0.1), cue salience (0.2), US salience for reinforced trials (0.2), and US salience for unreinforced trials (0.1).

In inhibGen.jpeg the simulation involved 100 each of A:A->X, A:B->Y, A:C->Z, and A:D->X trials during stage 1 where A: indicated context A: and A, B, C, and D are cues paired with outcomes X, Y, and Z (Z=no outcome). The trial order was randomised. In stage 2 (after 400 trials) the trial types were 80 each of B:A->Z, B:Y->Y, and B:C->Z again with order randomised. Stage 3 (after trial 640) involved 20 B:D->Z trials. 1000 simulations were carried out and the results were averaged to show associative strength for the configurations A:D and B:D at each point in the 660 trial sequence. The purpose of the simulation was to verify that the response to B:D was reduced when the model used reduced generalisation, relative to a condition in which 'normal' generalisation was used. 

In fnrGen.jpeg the simulation involved 100 each of I->X and IJ->Z trials (feature negative training) followed by feature negative reversal (after 200 trials) consisting of 80 each of J->X and M->Z trials. A further 20 I-X 'reminder' trials followed (after trial 360). 1000 simulations were carried out and the results were averaged to show associative strength for the configurations I and IJ at each point in the 380 trial sequence. The purpose of the simulation was to verify that the response to IJ was lower after the reversal trials (J->X) when the model used reduced generalisation, relative to a condition in which 'normal' generalisation was used.

The same trial sequences were used in simulations of the Rescorla-Wagner model using the same parameters (above, except d is not relevant). Simulations were carried out allowing unique configural cues for each pair of stimulus elements e.g. IJ -> IJij where ij is a unique configural cue for the conjunction of I an J or A:D -> A:Da:d where a:d is the conjunction of context A and cue D. The salience of configural cues was set at the average value of the elements represented divided by the number of elements represented (see Glautier, 2013).

In inhibGenRW.jpeg it was verified that the response to B:D was reduced when configural cues were included. In fnrGenRW.jpeg it was verified that the response to IJ was lower after the reversal trials when configural cues were included.
